32 BIT RACKETS

Thanks for checking out the world's most advanced tennis match simulator (circa 2001)!
If you're unfamiliar with the rules of tennis, you can brush up here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis

The controls are pretty simple:
- Press A to Jump
- Press B to swing your racket (remember: timing is important!)
- Press B to serve when prompted

You'll be up against a CPU capable of picking off the likes of Serena Williams in just a few swings.
You have the best of three sets to prove your skill.
Do you have what it takes to be the next world champ?
